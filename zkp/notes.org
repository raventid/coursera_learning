* Intro
C - arithmetic circuit;

S(C); (pp, vp) <- public params for prover and verifier

P(pp, x , w); len(π) = log(C)


V(vp, x, π); time() ??
vp - contains short summary of arithmetic circuit


** The trivial SNARK is not a SNARK
Prover sends w to verifier
Verifier checks if C(x, w) = 0 and accepts if so

Problems:
w might be long: we want a short proof
computing S(x, w) may be hard: we want a "fast" verifier
w might be a secret: prover might not want to reveal w to verifier
