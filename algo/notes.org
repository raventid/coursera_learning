#+TITLE: Notes


* Binary search complexity

It is very difficult to implement a correct binary search, because we have to be super carefull about all the indexes and movements inside.

first binary search was published in 1946.
first bug free binary search 1962.

despite this:
Java's Arrays.binarySearch() bug discovered in 2006. It is very difficult to write correct code.

#+begin_src c++
int bs(vecotr<int>& vec, int find_me) {
  int lo = 0;
  int hi = vec.size() - 1;

  while (lo <= hi) {
    int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
    if (find_me < a[mid]) {
      hi = mid - 1;
    } else if (find_me > a[mid]) {
      lo = mid + 1;
    } else {
      return mid;
    }
  }

  return -1;
}
