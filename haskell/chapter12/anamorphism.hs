-- As far as I understand this it is like stream in Racket:
-- (define ones (lambda () (cons 1 ones)))
-- But Racket can easily store different elements in list (dynamic types), I think that Haskell does
-- the next thing. GHC looks at this code and thinks - Hmmm, he asks me to build a list, but it's an
-- infinite recursion, oh I'm lazy! I can typecheck this and if thats write I can calculate tail only
-- when it's needed. The question is how does it know how to finish the list with ` lastElement : []`?

-- The question is how does it know how to finish the list with ` lastElement : []`?
-- This function is an attempt to answer where do we get `[]`.
-- Î»> myTake 2 $ myIterate id 1
-- [1,1]
-- In the example above we take two elements from myIterate generator and then we provide our own `[]`
-- The answer to question above is we finish the list by hand in myTake function, we don't need []
-- from iterator.

myTake 0 _ = [] -- we construct tail by hand here
myTake _ [] = [] -- and here

-- Well, how laziness works here?
-- The same way as in myIterate, and the question is more about `myUnfoldr`, then about `betterIterate` I guess
