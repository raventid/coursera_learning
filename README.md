# coursera_learning
Just my Coursera's homeworks and notes. Now it's more then that, I put here a big part of my exercises and thoughts about programming languages and other stuff (exercises from books I read). So it's my open, portable notebook. It's partly a junk, but sometimes you can find a really interesting note about Haskell here, or ATS, or Idris, or Coq (I hardly ever have a compulsion to leave a comment with my attitude toward some language construction, but when it happens, it's funny to read after a few months).
