1. Basic stack intro:

add
sub
neg
or


2. Memory segments:

push constant 17
pop local 2
pop static 5
push argument 3

We have 8 virtual memory segments:

1. local
2. argument
3. this
4. that
5. constant
6. static
7. pointer
8. temp

Memory segments are accessed randomly. You can read from stack 2 or 3. You can push
to arguments 2 or 4, that's not a problem.
