#+TITLE: 191 Number_of_1_bits

Topics: bit manipulation

Here we are implementing a very simple approach, iterating over bits in number and on every step we are changing a mask by moving a bit to the left.

So, we are starting with the following mask:

0000000000000000001;

And then we are moving this mask structure to the next state like:

mask = mask << 1; // move bit in the mask

0000000000000000010;

#+begin_src c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
      uint32_t mask = 1;
      int counter = 0;

      for(int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
          if((n & mask) != 0) {
              counter++;
          }

          mask = mask << 1; // move bit in the mask
      }

      return counter;
    }
};
