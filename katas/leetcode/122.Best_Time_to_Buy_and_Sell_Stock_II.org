#+TITLE: 122 Best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock_ii

My initial attemp in which I made a mistake and didn't understood that I can buy and sell stocks multiple times and not only one time.

#+begin_src c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int max_profit = 0;
        int buy = 0;
        int sell = 0;

        while(sell < prices.size()) {
            int profit = prices[sell] - prices[buy];

            if(profit < 0) {
                buy = sell;
            } else {
                max_profit = std::max(max_profit, profit);
            }

            sell++;
        }

        return max_profit;
    }
};
#+end_src
