#+title: 2275 Largest Combination With Bitwise And Greater Than Zero

Summary: check how many bits are `1` at every position in 32-bit integer,
this is enough to understand how many numbers could be combined to number more than 0 with bitwise AND operation

#+begin_src c++
class Solution {
public:
    int largestCombination(vector<int>& candidates) {
        std::array<int, 32> buffer;

        for (int candidate : candidates) {
            int buffer_index = 0;
            int mask = 1;

            while (buffer_index < 32) {
                auto is_bit_enabled = candidate & mask;

                if (is_bit_enabled) {
                    buffer[buffer_index] += 1;
                }

                mask = mask << 1;
                buffer_index += 1;
            }
        }

        return *std::max_element(buffer.begin(), buffer.end());
    }
