#+TITLE: 704 Binary_search

The most standard and basic implementation.

Tip: maybe guess and target are not the good names for variables?
Also when you type quickly you sometimes mix hi and lo instructions. Use imagination better to lead your intution, not only relay on speed-typing and memory.

#+begin_src c++
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = nums.size() - 1;

        while(lo <= hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;

            int guess = nums[mid];

            if(guess > target) {
                hi = mid - 1;
            } else if(guess < target) {
                lo = mid + 1;
            } else {
                return mid;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
