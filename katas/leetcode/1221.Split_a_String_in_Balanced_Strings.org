#+TITLE: 1221 Split_a_string_in_balanced_strings

Very simple implementation, initially I thought to use two counter, but I quickly noticed the simple arithmetic and understood that I don't actually need to apply anything similar to 2-counters, one thing is enough for me.

#+begin_src c++
class Solution {
public:
    int balancedStringSplit(string s) {
        int diff = 0;
        int counter = 0;

        for(const char c : s) {
            if(c == 'R') {
                diff++;
            }
            if(c == 'L') {
                diff--;
            }

            if(diff == 0) {
                counter++;
            }
        }

        return counter;
    }
};
#+end_src
