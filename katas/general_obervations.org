* My mistakes and their reasons

** C++
*** i = 0 instead of i == 0 in comparisons like if (i == 0)

Mitigation?

Possibly use 0 == i, looks ugly, but helps to avoid the problem


*** not enought const usage, just be more careful about it

*** floating point errors on distance related programs
std::ceil(a / b); vs (a + b - 1) / b;
std::floor(a / b); vs (a - 1) / b

* My own tasks I find interesting

Imaging you are trading multiple stocks on the market. You are provided with a few vector<int> with a different stock prices.

Apple: [1,2,3,4,3,19,12,20,7]
Microsoft: [5,4,5,6,1,2,3,4]
Ibm: [5,97,6,4,3,5,78]

Those vectors size are the same size. You can trade stocks any day (buy and sell in the same time if needed).

Questions:

What is the maximum profit you can get out of all trading time?
What is the highest profit you can get from trading every stock? (on what days you should've bought and sell the stock)
